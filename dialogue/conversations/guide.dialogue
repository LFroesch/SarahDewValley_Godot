	Jerry: You then need to water it once, and they each grow over 4 days.
	Jerry: You can feed the animals with the crates near their pastures.
	Jerry: Feeding them will give you Milk & Eggs (and make them happy!)

- Ask about Gathering
	Jerry: You can chop down trees and mine rocks for extra resources.
	Jerry: They are not currently used in this patch. More to come soon!
	=> guide_options
- Ask about Combat
	Jerry: To fight monsters like Goblins, use your axe tool the same way you would chop a tree.
	Jerry: Or cast magic spells! Hotkeys can be found in Ask About Controls.
