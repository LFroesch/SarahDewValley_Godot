Jerry: Let me tell you about the controls / how to play this game.
- Ask about Farming
	Jerry: You can till the ground with your hoe and then plant Corn & Tomatoes.
	Jerry: You then need to water it once, and they each grow over 4 days.
	Jerry: You can feed the animals with the crates near their pastures.
	Jerry: Feeding them will give you Milk & Eggs (and make them happy!)
	=> guide_options
- Ask about Gathering
	Jerry: You can chop down trees and mine rocks for extra resources.
	Jerry: They are not currently used in this patch. More to come soon!
	=> guide_options
- Ask about Combat
	Jerry: To fight monsters like Goblins, use your axe tool the same way you would chop a tree.
	Jerry: Or cast magic spells! Hotkeys can be found in Ask About Controls.
	Jerry: Magic abilities like those currently have a cooldown, but later youll use mana on them.
	Jerry: Keep your health above 0 by eating food and hit them enough times to kill them.
	Jerry: Monsters can drop different loot depending on their type!
