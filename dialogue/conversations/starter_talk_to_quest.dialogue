Larry: [[Hi|Hello|Howdy]], I've got some tasks for you!
Larry: You're new around here so to get you settled in, go talk to some of my friends!
Larry: Go talk to my friend Steve to the East in Brady Town. He will tell you about the sewers!
Larry: Also go talk to Farmer Dave southeast of here, cross the bridge south and then head east.
Larry: If you haven't yet, there are some combat quests to the West from another Quest Giver.
Larry: I also want to tell you about the healing crystals, there is one right by us, if you stand next to it, you will heal.
